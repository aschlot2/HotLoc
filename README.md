# HotLoc

HotLoc is a static site template built for location-focused projects. It
uses the **Dimension** theme from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net), a
responsive one-page design with modal-like sections and a depth effect.

## Usage

Open `index.html` directly in your browser or serve the site locally with
any static web server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then navigate to <http://localhost:8000>.
